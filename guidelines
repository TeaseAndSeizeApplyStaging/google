User Content and Conduct Policy                                   Googleâs social and sharing products and services enable people from diverse             backgrounds to start conversations, share experiences, collaborate on projects, and             form new communities. Our policies play an important role in maintaining a positive             experience for our users on the products listed below (collectively referred to as the             âServicesâ). Please follow these policies as you:                                   use Google+, including Google+ comments on other products such as Blogger                          participate in publicly shared Hangouts or Hangouts on Air                          send Hangouts invitations                          share content by link or print content through Google Photos.                                                We depend heavily upon users to let us know about content that may violate our             policies. After we are notified of a potential policy violation, we may review the             content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the             content, refusing to print the content and limiting or terminating a userâs access to             Google products. Note that we may make exceptions to these policies based on artistic,             educational, or documentary considerations, or when there are other substantial             benefits to the public from not taking action.                                   We occasionally modify these policies, so please check back here for any updates.             Beyond the policies listed below, note that several products and features may have             additional policies and terms â please check the links provided for those additional             requirements.                                                                   Illegal Activities                                               Do not use our Services to engage in illegal activities or to promote activities                 that are dangerous and illegal, such as the sale of illegal drugs or human                 trafficking.                                               We may also remove content that violates applicable local laws.

Malicious and Deceptive Practices                                               Do not transmit viruses, malware, or any other malicious or destructive code. Do                 not distribute content that harms or interferes with the operation of the networks,                 servers, or other infrastructure of Google or others. Do not use our Services for                 phishing scams.                                                                         Hate Speech                                               Our products are platforms for free expression, but we donât permit hate speech.                 Hate speech is content that promotes or condones violence against or has the                 primary purpose of inciting hatred against an individual or group on the basis of                 their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran                 status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other characteristic                 that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.                                                                         Harassment, Bullying, and Threats                                               Do not engage in harassing, bullying, or threatening behavior, and do not incite                 others to engage in these activities. Anyone using our Services to single someone                 out for malicious abuse, to threaten someone with serious harm, to sexualize a                 person in an unwanted way, or to harass in other ways may have the offending                 content removed or be permanently banned from using the Services. In emergency                 situations, we may escalate imminent threats of serious harm to law enforcement.                 Keep in mind that online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have                 serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the victim.                                               Learn more about                 additional steps that you can take to stop harassment and bullying on Google+.                                                                         Personal and Confidential Information                                               Do not distribute other peopleâs personal and confidential information, such as                 credit card numbers, confidential national ID numbers, or account passwords,                 without their permission. Do not post or distribute images or videos of minors                 without the necessary consent from their legal representatives. Report a                 violation                                                                         Child Exploitation                                               Do not upload or share content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all                 child sexual abuse imagery (even cartoon images) and all content that presents                 children in a sexual manner. We will remove such content and take appropriate                 action, which may include disabling accounts and reporting to the National Center                 for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement. Note that this policy                 may additionally apply to any content uploaded or transmitted through our Services.                                               If you find any content that you think exploits children in this manner, do not +1,                 reshare or comment on such content, even if your intent is to bring it to Googleâs                 attention. Instead, flag the content through the âReport                 Abuseâ link. If you find content elsewhere on the internet, please contact                 NCMEC directly.                                                                         Spam                                               Do not spam, including by sending unwanted promotional or commercial content, or                 unwanted or mass solicitation.                                               Do not aggressively send invitations, add people to your circles, or message people                 that you do not know.                                                                         Ranking Manipulation                                               Do not manipulate ranking or relevancy using techniques like repetitive or                 misleading keywords or metadata.                                                                         Sexually Explicit Material                                               Do not distribute sexually explicit or pornographic material. Do not drive traffic                 to commercial pornography sites.                                               We do allow naturalistic and documentary depictions of nudity (such as an image of                 a breastfeeding infant), as well as depictions of nudity that serve a clear                 educational, scientific, or artistic purpose.                                               Note that your Google+ profile photo cannot include mature or offensive content.                 For example, do not use a photo that is a close-up of a personâs buttocks or                 cleavage.                                                                         Violence                                               It's not okay to post violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be                 shocking, sensational, or gratuitous. If posting graphic content in a news,                 documentary, scientific, or artistic context, please be mindful to provide enough                 information to help people understand what's going on. In some cases, content may                 be so violent or shocking that no amount of context will allow that content to                 remain on our platforms. Lastly, don't encourage others to commit specific acts of                 violence.                                                                         Regulated Goods and Services                                               Our Services enable discussion of many topics, but we do not allow content that                 facilitates the sale of regulated products and services, including alcohol,                 gambling, pharmaceuticals and unapproved supplements, tobacco, fireworks, weapons,                 or health/medical devices.                                               Because these topics are often heavily regulated and may not be appropriate for all                 ages or in all countries, we have created tools on Google+ to help you target your                 content to users of the appropriate ages in the right markets. If your content                 promotes regulated goods and services, you are responsible for applying the                 appropriate age and geographical restrictions for that content where these tools                 are available. If we receive a complaint that such content is targeting audiences                 in violation of applicable laws and regulations, we may remove or restrict the                 offending content or account.                                               Even with the appropriate age and geographical restrictions in place, we still do                 not allow the facilitation of the sale of the products listed above.

Impersonation and misrepresentation                                               Do not use our services with the intent to deceive, mislead or confuse users by                 either impersonating any person or organizations you do not represent, or                 concealing your ownership or primary purpose. This includes directing content about                 politics, social issues, or matters of public concern to users in a country other                 than your own, if you misrepresent or intentionally conceal your country of origin                 or other material details about yourself. We're not saying you can't publish                 parody, satire or use a pseudonym/pen name - just avoid content that is likely to                 mislead readers about your true identity.                                               Learn more about                 Impersonation on Google+.                                                                         Account Hijacking                                               Do not access another userâs account without their permission.                                                                         Use of Multiple Accounts                                               Do not create or use multiple accounts to evade our policies or bypass blocks or                 otherwise subvert restrictions placed on your account. For example, if youâve been                 blocked by another user or suspended for abuse, donât create a replacement account                 that engages in similar activity.                                                                         Terrorist Content                                               We do not permit terrorist organizations to use Google+ for any purpose, including                 recruitment. Google+ also strictly prohibits content related to terrorism, such as                 content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist                 attacks.                                               If posting content related to terrorism for an educational, documentary,                 scientific, or artistic purpose, be mindful to provide enough information so                 viewers understand the context.                                                               About our Policies and Terms                                   These policies apply generally to the content you post on our Services. Some services             have their own separate policies that can be found within those services and apply to             your use of them. All Google products and services are governed by their applicable             terms of service.                                   Reporting Potential Issues                                   If you encounter content or a user that you believe violates the above policies, please             report it to us using the âReport Abuseâ link (or similarly named link).
